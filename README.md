### Summary
This project explores and visualized various price metrics for real esatae data in the province of Nova Scotia. Using BeautifulSoup in Python I scraped property data from [www.royallepage.ca](https://www.royallepage.ca/en/) writing it to an excel file. I then cleaned the data in excel using tools such as remove duplicates, various sorting techniques, and creating functions to filter my data. Finally, I presented my data in an easy to use dashboard with an interative map that allows you to select specific cities or certain regions to find the highest and lowest priced cities as well as the average and median price. I also included a second page that displays the distribution of property types and the normal distribution of the property prices for each type.
